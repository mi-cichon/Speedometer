# Speedometer

Speedometer is a side project which was intended to use in my other project (RageMP Server).

It is a simple speedometer overlay with basic functionalities such as:

-dynamic drawing (steps are adjusted based on vehicles max speed)\
-RPM bar (using progressbar.js)\
-Fuel bar (using progressbar.js)\
-Vehicle and street name\
-Digital display indicating speed\
-Trip of the vehicle
